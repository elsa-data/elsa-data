# ADR 0006 - Able to Run With or Without Cloud

An application can be designed with native cloud deployment as the primary
focus, or can be designed to use more neutral (non cloud) technologies. The
project needs to decide whether it is adopting cloud native technologies at the
outset.

## When

July 2022.

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

## Decision

Decided on non-cloud as deployment to HPC/internal is a desired use case.

## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?

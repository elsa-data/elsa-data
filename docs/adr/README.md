# ADR

Preliminary or in discussion ADR entries should be named just with their number - but
once a decision has been made - the ADR file should be renamed to reflect the decision.

i.e `0003.md` -> `0003-use-edgedb-for-database.md`.

Preliminary or in discussion ADR entries should have their status left blank until they are
either `Accepted` or `Withdrawn`.

Title/status/status date is maintained _only_ in the table below
AND NOT IN THE ADR FILES THEMSELVES! This avoids
duplication of this information - but is a bit non-obvious so apologies.

If needed an earlier ADR entry can be replaced in which case the status should change to `Replaced by XXXX`.

| Number | Title                                                                              | Status   | Status Date   |

# Elsa Data documentation

## Architecture decision record

We maintain an architecture decision record (ADR) in the
[ADR](adr) folder.

See https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record
for details of what an ADR is.

## Diagrams

Diagrams are editable in place using Draw IO Desktop (download at
https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases). Diagrams have the
file suffix `.drawio.svg` or `.drawio.png`. The Draw IO file data is embedded
into the SVG or PNG - so make sure you don't process the SVGs or PNGs with a
tool that will lose that information.
